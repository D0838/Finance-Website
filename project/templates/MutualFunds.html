                <p>A mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</h3>
                <p>A SIP allows investors to invest a fixed amount regularly in a mutual fund scheme. This scheme helps in averaging the cost of investment and instills a disciplined approach to investing.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Invest regularly, grow steadily."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan)</h3>
                <p>SWP enables investors to withdraw a fixed amount from their mutual fund investment at regular intervals. This scheme is useful for those who need regular income from their investments.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Your regular income, our priority."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>STP (Systematic Transfer Plan)</h3>
                <p>STP allows investors to transfer a fixed amount from one mutual fund scheme to another at regular intervals. This helps in managing risk and aligning investments with market conditions.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Smart transfers for balanced growth."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>Dividend Payout</h3>
                <p>In the Dividend Payout scheme, investors receive dividends from the mutual fund's earnings at regular intervals. This provides periodic income to the investors.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Reap the rewards regularly."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>Dividend Reinvestment</h3>
                <p>In this scheme, the dividends declared by the mutual fund are reinvested back into the scheme. This helps in compounding the returns over time.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Let your dividends grow further."</div>
            </div>

            <div class="scheme">
                <h3>Growth Option</h3>
                <p>Under the Growth Option, the profits made by the mutual fund are reinvested in the scheme itself. Investors do not receive any interim payouts, and the returns are realized only when the units are redeemed.</p>
                <div class="slogan">"Watch your wealth accumulate."</div>
